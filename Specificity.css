/* Question => If one element is styled by more than one rule, which style will be applicable? */
/* Explanation of question =>
    Specificity.html
        <div>
            <p class="red-p">Text...</p>
        </div>
    Specificity.css
        p {
            color: green;
        } 1 point

        .red-p {
            color: red;
        } 10 points

        div .red-p {
            color: blue;
        } 11 points

        div .red-p {
            color: yellow;
        } 11 points

        Note: If same rule written two or more times in external sheet then last rule will be applicable
 */

 /* Answer => More specific rule will get more value */

 /* General Rule */
    /* 1. !important will override every thing */
    /* 2. Inline can override everything except !important */
    /* 3. External will work according to specificity */

    /* (#) Id selector has highest value */
    /* (*) Universal selector has lowest value   */

/* Specificity Rule Trick(Point System) */
    /* 1. 10,000 points to !important */
    /* 2. 1,000 points to inline */
    /* 3. 100 points to id */
    /* 4. 10 points to class, attribute or pseudo-class */
    /* 5. 1 for element selector and pseudo-elements */
    /* 6. 0 to Universal selector */
